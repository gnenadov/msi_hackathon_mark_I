            <p>The world is currently facing unprecendented challenges. One of those many challenges is adapting practically every professional workplace to operate remotely. We want to help ease that transition and reduce the challenges workers face performing their jobs at home.</p>

            <p>The people of the world are scared of one another. The coronavirus pandemic grows worse by the day, with cases breaking out in different cities every hour. With so many outbreaks it's hard to stay on top of the news. We want to help provide people across the world with information that they can use to protect themselves.</p>
